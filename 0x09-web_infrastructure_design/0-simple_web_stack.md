<h4>What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com</h4>

<h4>SPOF</h4>
there is multiple single point of Failures 
e.g if the internet is down every thing is down
<h4>Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)</h4>
when we need mentainance we had to turn off the server b/c we have only one server 
<h4>Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic</h4>
it would be hard to scale in this infrastructure.we don't have any lode balancer .The server become slower when it starts reciving multiple requests at the same time
